The Common Cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) is a migratory bird species known for its characteristic 
"cuckoo" call. This bird is widely recognized in the Netherlands and other parts of Europe as a 
harbinger of spring. Monitoring its population and migration patterns provides valuable insights into 
environmental health, as changes in its presence can indicate shifts in the ecosystem. 

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of recognizing and 
classifying the Common Cuckoo's call from audio recordings. By automating the detection process, 
researchers can efficiently monitor cuckoo populations, aiding conservation efforts and ecological 
studies.
